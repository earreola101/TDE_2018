The DTM function has been integrated to Meridian firmware. There're 3 attachments, 2 for firmware update and the other one is a video clip that demonstrated how Meridian works DTM with Anritsu MT8852B. Please follow the steps as below, and feel free to let me know if you have any question.
1. Updating Meridian firmware to 1.0.69 by "FWUpdateMeridian-DEV.exe".
2. Unzip "Meridian_BLE_fw_update.zip", and updating Meridian BLE firmware through instruction " ndfwupt.exe -p 2151 -c fw_upt_app meridian_fw.bin ".
3. Checking Meridian BLE firmware version by " ndfwupt.exe -p 2151 -c get_fw_ver ", it should return "1000070".
